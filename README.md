## Testing

1. Overall website:
    1. Made sure that all hyperlink is working.
    2. Made sure that the user informations are uploaded to the database.
    3. Checked that all the product details are valid and in current market costs.
    4. Made sure that the animations in hompage, floating flex, and roullete work properly.

2. Individual pages:
    1. Aligned the contents accordingly, which could vary for different screen resolutions.
    2. Made sure that the colour scheme matches throughout all pages.
    3. Check for ghost links if any.  

3. Features:
    1. At the end after coding APIs and getting it to work, we had a hard time making the database work. Retrieving information and inputting in different pages were difficult.
    2. Checked the cart page to make sure that the 'purchase comeplete' pop up message works consistently.
    
4. Path:
    1. Initially there was errors in image paths in which it worked on some systems and didn't in others, which we finally managed to fix.
    2. There were a few ghost links, which later on, we fixed.

In addition, the project looks and works fine on different browsers and screen sizes.
The platforms tested are - Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Android, IOS and opera.

We came accross several bugs and unintentional mistakes from simple missed hyphens to troublesome APIs. But most of them are fixed.
